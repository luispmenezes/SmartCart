  The students must use, in order to achieve this subject objectives, in the developed app all or some features and technologies that were learned in the classes, such as use of Fragments, Services, Intents, AsyncTasks and Content Provider, students also must use some king of integration in this app, like make use of sensors, hardware or external API’s, the app should also have a design that provide a User Experience that the users are expecting to see and of course it must resolve the proposed problem.
  This app its designed to be used in a supermarket that has a database with his products and a computer file system for register all the purchases made. The users (clients of a supermarket) can register in the app and then they can made their purchase by themselves scanning the barcodes or QRCodes of the products that they want to buy, in the end, a QRCode is generated to be shown to the supermarket employee for registration in the system and print the receipt. After the purchases the user can consult all the purchases made before for compare prices for example.
